# Personal Website

A second version of [my portfolio](https://gilbert-james.vercel.app) to showcase current projects.

## Project Status

Being the second version of my portfolio, I've incorporated some new concepts; chat static files are gotten from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) with two locales ([English](https://gilbert-james.vercel.app/en) & [Spanish](https://gilbert-james.vercel.app/es)). Internationalization in the web application has been implemented and its handled by the "[Next-Intl](https://github.com/vriad/next-intl)" library with translations in both locales discussed earlier.

For the admin, AI chatbot has been setup and instructed to respond to messages using my profile and experiences as base.
